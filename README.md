## Contribution Guidelines

To keep the tutorial consistent throughout, please follow a few guidelines when editing the HTML files:

- Pay attention to screen reader compatibility. Many Knight Manager players are blind and therefore rely on screen reading software. So use the best semantics possible.
- If you want to participate in the translation from German into English, stick to the content structure of the German version and keep it in the code as well
- If you rename sections, make sure to adjust their id attribute in the <h> tag if necessary and also reference them correctly in the table of contents so that the section remains directly accessible when clicking on it.
